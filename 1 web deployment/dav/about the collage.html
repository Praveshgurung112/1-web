                    <p>MCM DAV College Kangra is a strong link in the chain of DAV institutions that have <br> come to serve the cause of education and social upliftment not only in our country <br> but also in many foreign countries like USA, UK, Japan, Mauritius, Nepal etc <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After the reorganization of states, a need for an institution of higher education was <br>felt in this area, as the entire Kangra district had only one Government College. <br> In 1975 DAV College Kangra was established. It was later renamed as MCM DAV  <br> College in memory of the great jurist from the area -Sh Mehar Chand Mahajan.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The College was established in an area which was then educationally and <br> economically backward. In the last four decades of service the College can proudly <br> claim to have substantially changed the education scenario. Our pass outs have <br> excelled in every field â€“ academics, bureaucracy, armed forces, sports, business, <br> private sector, and even in politics and governance. An educational institution does <br> not need any testimonials other than students who excel, and are productive <br> citizens.
                        <br>
                        The college has been granted permanent affiliation by HPU Shimla vide letter no. <br> 1/44-1/74-HPU(ACD) dated 23.11.1979 and is also included in the lists prepared <br> under section 2(f) and 12(B) of the UGC ACT 1956.</p>
